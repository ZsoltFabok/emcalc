If you are a head hunter check out the [work branch][1] before you jump to a conclusion about this app or my work :-)

### History

In 2004 my friend asked me to write him an application - called emcalc - that used his results from his thesis work that he can use in his new job. The application was able to tell the gas emission of different boilers that was common in the households in our neighbourhood at that time. I forgot about this application until I found its jar file on an old hard drive. At xp2013 I used this application to show some technique on how to test and start to work on legacy code and when Emily Bache saw it, she asked me if it were possible to make it open source so that people could practice refactoring on a legacy code that was actually used by people. I talked to my friend and he agreed to make it open source, so here is the repository to emcalc under the 3-clause BSD license:
